# RAG-Techniques
DSPY is a framework designed to optimize language model (LM) prompts and weights, making it a breeze to build complex systems with GPT-4 and T5-base. It smartly separates program flow from LM parameters and uses optimizers to tune these parameters based on your desired metrics.
No more manual tweaking â€“ DSPy handles it all! Its tools like ChainOfThought and ReAct enhance reliability and efficiency in LM-driven tasks.
This repo is a public workspace for anyone who wants to contribute about the latest RAG techniques in the GenAI landscape.
